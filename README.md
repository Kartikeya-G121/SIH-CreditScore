## 🚩 Problem Overview  

Current government and NGO loan systems often fail to target genuine low-income beneficiaries due to:

- ❌ **Unverified or self-declared income data**
- 🕒 **Manual, time-consuming loan approvals**
- ⚙️ **Incomplete or inconsistent applicant data**
- 🧾 **No AI-driven or explainable risk scoring system**

As a result, deserving applicants are often excluded, while ineligible individuals gain access to funds.
